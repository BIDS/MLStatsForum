The new Berkeley Statistics and Machine Learning Discussion Group will meet
biweekly to discuss statistical and data science methods and their applications
across a wide variety of domain research sciences.

Hosted by UC Berkeley Physics Professor and BIDS Senior Fellow
[Uros Seljak](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/uros-seljak), these active
sessions will bring together domain scientists, statisticians and computer
scientists who are either developing state-of-the-art methods or are interested
in applying these methods in their research.
Participants are able to contribute actively and propose discussion topics in
preparation for each meeting. The emphasis will be on applicative aspects of the
methods.

Practical questions about the meetings can be directed to BIDS Fellow
