The [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu) (BIDS) <b>Machine Learning and Science Forum</b> meets biweekly to discuss current applications across a wide variety of research domains in the physical sciences and beyond. Hosted by BIDS Affiliates Physics Professor [Uroš Seljak](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/uros-seljak) and LBNL Physics Staff Scientist [Ben Nachman](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/benjamin-nachman), these active sessions bring together domain scientists, statisticians, and computer scientists who are either developing state-of-the-art methods or are interested in applying these methods in their research. All interested members of the UC Berkeley and Berkeley Lab communities are welcome and encouraged to attend. To receive email notifications about upcoming meetings, or to request more information, please contact the organizers (Vanessa Boehm, Aditi Krishnapriyan, Vinicius Mikuni, Mariel Pettee, and Shashank Subramania) at [berkeleymlforum@gmail.com](mailto:berkeleymlforum@gmail.com).
