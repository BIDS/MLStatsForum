The [Berkeley Institute for Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu) (BIDS)
<b>Machine Learning and Science Forum</b> meets biweekly to discuss current
applications across a wide variety of research domains in the physical sciences
and beyond. Hosted by BIDS Affiliates Physics Professor [Uroš
Seljak](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/uros-seljak) and LBNL Physics Staff
Scientist [Ben Nachman](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/benjamin-nachman),
these active sessions bring together domain scientists, statisticians, and
computer scientists who are either developing state-of-the-art methods or are
interested in applying these methods in their research. All interested members
of the UC Berkeley and Berkeley Lab communities are welcome and encouraged to
attend. To receive email notifications about upcoming meetings, or to request
more information, please contact the organizers (Vanessa Boehm, Aditi
Krishnapriyan, Vinicius Mikuni, Mariel Pettee, Fernando Torales Acosta, and Shashank Subramanian) at [berkeleymlforum@gmail.com](mailto:berkeleymlforum@gmail.com).
