The Berkeley Statistics and Machine Learning Forum meets biweekly to discuss current applications across a wide variety of research domains and software methodologies. Hosted by UC Berkeley Physics Professor and BIDS Senior Fellow [Uros Seljak](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/uros-seljak), these active
sessions bring together domain scientists, statisticians and computer scientists
who are either developing state-of-the-art methods or are interested in applying
these methods in their research. Practical questions about the meetings can be
directed to BIDS Data Science Fellow [Fran√ßois Lanusse](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/fran%C3%A7ois-lanusse).

All interested members of the UC Berkeley and LBL communities are welcome and
encouraged to attend.
