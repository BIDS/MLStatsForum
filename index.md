The Machine Learning and Science Forum (formerly the Berkeley Statistics and Machine Learning Forum) meets biweekly to discuss current applications across a wide variety of research domains in the physical sciences and beyond. Hosted by UC Berkeley Physics Professor and BIDS Senior Fellow [Uroš Seljak](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/uros-seljak), these active sessions bring together domain scientists, statisticians, and computer scientists who are either developing state-of-the-art methods or are interested in applying these methods in their research. All interested members of the UC Berkeley and Berkeley Lab communities are welcome and encouraged to attend. To receive email notifications about upcoming meetings, or to request more information, please contact the organizers (Vanessa Boehm, Marin Bukov, and Ben Nachman) at [berkeleymlforum@gmail.com](mailto:berkeleymlforum@gmail.com).
