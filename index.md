The Berkeley Statistics and Machine Learning Forum meets biweekly to discuss current applications across a wide variety of research domains and software methodologies. Hosted by UC Berkeley Physics Professor and BIDS Senior Fellow [Uros Seljak](https://bids.berkeley.edu/people/uros-seljak), these active
sessions bring together domain scientists, statisticians and computer scientists
who are either developing state-of-the-art methods or are interested in applying
these methods in their research.
Participants are able to contribute actively and propose discussion topics in
preparation for each meeting. The emphasis will be on applicative aspects of the
methods. All interested members of the UC Berkeley, LBL and LLNL communities are welcome to attend.

Practical questions about the meetings can be directed to BIDS Fellow
